## Data

These data come from a long-term monitoring project that was started by Dr. Steve Ressel in 2015. Over the years, many COA students have contributed to this project and have helped with data collection. Some preliminary findings from this project were recently published in a regional journal called Northeastern Naturalist (Ressel et al. 2023, full citation below). For this exploratory data analysis project, I mostly worked with unpublished data collected in the past two years by Jasper White (2022) and Wriley Hodge (2023).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge and thank all of the research assistants over the years who have participated in this project and spent long, rainy nights at the site in order to collect this data. I would especially like to thank my advisor and the P.I. of this project, Dr. Steve Ressel, for teaching me so much about herpetology and field research. Special thanks goes to both Jasper White and Wriley Hodge for their hard work and dedication in sponsoring the past two field seasons of tireless data collection, and an additional thank you to Wriley Hodge for helping me think through data wrangling and analysis for this project. Thank you also to Laurie Baker for her instruction and advice; this project was prepared as part of her Data Science II: Programming for Data Analysis class. Finally, I would like to thank the charming and delightful population of Spotted Salamanders who have been both the reason for and the subject of this study. It is our sincere hope that the findings of this project will inform the conservation and careful stewardship of these and other coastal amphibian species.
