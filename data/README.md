# Data

These data were collected as part of the Otter Point Salamander Project (unofficial name) which has been monitoring a population of Spotted Salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) that breed in a series of rocky cliff pools by the Atlantic Ocean. The dataset that I will be using for my final project includes 9 years worth of data about salamander presence/absence, returns, and environmental conditions (salinity, temperature) of the breeding pools. The most recent seasons (2022 & 2023) also include data about individual salamanders marked with unique numeric microchips called PIT tags. I still have a lot of data cleaning and merging to do.
