# Data

These data were collected as part of the Otter Point Salamander Project (unofficial name) which has been monitoring a population of Spotted Salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) that breed in a series of rocky cliff pools by the Atlantic Ocean for the past 9 years. The dataset that I will be using for my final project includes all 9 years worth of data about salamander presence/absence, returns, and environmental conditions (salinity, temperature) of the breeding pools for each night of fieldwork. The most recent seasons (2022 & 2023) also include data about individual salamanders marked with unique numeric microchips called PIT tags. Across these two seasons, interesting questions arise about the pool fidelity and movement between pools of individual salamanders. 

I still have a lot of data cleaning and merging to do, but here is an overview of the variables:
